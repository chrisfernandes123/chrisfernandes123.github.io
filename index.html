                            My name is Chris. I've been in the industry for close to 20 years with global work
                            experience.
                            I am passionate about the synergy between business and technology.
                            <br><br>
                            I have expertise in Accounting, Management,
                            Information Technology, Supply Chain Management, Six Sigma / Lean Manufacturing, and I can
                            develop solutions in more
                            than 15 programming languages. As challenging as my work seems to get, I truly love working
                            with people to solve problems.

                            My main passion is my family. Work usually consumes the majority of my time, so I
                            thoroughly enjoy
                            my down time. I enjoy planning various events and outings for my family and I take full
                            advantage of
                            the few weekends we have as a part of the short Toronto summers.

                            Advanced scheduling is imperitive when dealing with multiple parties. Perhaps I will
                            develop a family
                            event scheduling web application to help identify availability and interest in various
                            events.
                            <br><br>
                            I am really interested in getting to the Javascript section and the database connectivity
                            work.
                            The possibilities seem endless!
